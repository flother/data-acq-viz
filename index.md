This three-week course is a hands-on introduction to data acquisition and visualisation aimed at undergraduate students in
[Reykjavík University's] [content1] computer science department. It covers the complete process of finding data sources, collecting and cleaning data, using best practices to visualise data, and selecting the tools suitable for each step.
 
These concepts are applied in a practical project where you will apply your new knowledge to make a static or interactive data visualisation. In the first two weeks, alongside lectures on data visualisation and acquisition, you will develop your project’s concept and framework incrementally. The final week is devoted to refining your project with support from the lecturers.

* Tools


## Course assessment

* Question paper (10%)
* Student group presentation (90%)
    * Concept (10%)
    * Implementation and methods (20%)
    * Quality of visualisations (40%)
    * Quality and content of the presentation and report (30%)

You are required to attend, participate actively, and complete paper, presentation, and report. Both the presentation and report must be in English. The expected workload for students is 150 hours.


## Teaching methods

The course consists of:

* Lectures
* Practical work in groups
* Preparing and presenting a group presentation
* Writing a report
* Recommended reading
* Recommended podcasts

The lectures will cover the course syllabus while the practical work will allow student groups to find, prepare, and visualise data to use in their group presentation. During the practical work the lecturers will be at hand to answer questions and give guidance. The written report (approximately 1,000 words) will summarise the data analysis and visualisation. The recommended reading and podcasts are to support the concepts covered in the lectures.
